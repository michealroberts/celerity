class Transmission(TypedDict):
    # The transmission coefficient of an optical element, which is the fraction of light
    # that passes through the element. This is typically a value between 0 and 1.
    # A value of 1 means that all light passes through the element, while a value of 0
    # means that no light passes through:
    coefficient: float


# **************************************************************************************


class SurfaceReflectance(TypedDict):
    # The albedo of a reflecting surface, which is the fraction of light that is
    # reflected by the surface (e.g., the primary mirror of a telescope). This is
    # typically a value between 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that all light is reflected
    # (perfect reflector) by the surface, while a value of 0 means that no light is
    # reflected (black body):
    albedo: float
